##  Overview

Aspecta-parser is a software project designed to extract and process user data from the Aspecta.ai platform. It efficiently identifies eligible users based on specific criteria, such as the presence of designated labels and a valid wallet address. The project leverages a robust configuration system to manage application settings and utilizes dedicated modules for file management, data structure definition, and data processing. Aspecta-parser streamlines the process of organizing user data into separate output files, enabling efficient analysis and downstream applications.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project employs a modular design with a `main.py` file coordinating data extraction and processing. It utilizes a configuration file (`config.py`, `config.json`) and separate modules for models (`models`) and utility functions (`utils`). This architecture promotes code organization and reusability. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase demonstrates good readability and adheres to Python style conventions. It employs clear variable and function names, along with comments to explain functionality. The project's structure is well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The code is well-documented with inline comments and docstrings. While no external documentation is provided, the code itself is relatively easy to understand due to the clear structure and comments. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | The project integrates with the Aspecta.ai platform to extract user data. It relies on the `json` library for data parsing and manipulation. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase is highly modular, with dedicated modules for configuration, models, and utilities. This design allows for easy maintenance and potential future expansion. The `models` package provides reusable data structures for user information, links, and labels. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | No explicit testing framework or unit tests are found in the provided codebase. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The project's performance is not explicitly assessed. The asynchronous nature of the `fileUtils` module could potentially improve performance for file operations. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | The project does not include specific security measures for data protection or access control. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | The project primarily relies on Python's built-in libraries, including `json`, `os`, and `sys`. It does not utilize any external libraries. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | The current implementation is not designed for high-volume data processing or scaling. It relies on processing user data individually, which could become inefficient with larger datasets. |

##  Modules

<details closed><summary>.</summary>

| File | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [config.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/config.py) | The `config.py` file serves as the central configuration manager for the repository. It loads environment variables and reads a JSON configuration file to provide access to application-wide settings. This file enables flexible customization of the applications behavior and ensures consistency across different environments. |
| [main.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/main.py) | The `main.py` file is the core component of the AspectaParser repository, responsible for extracting and processing user data from the Aspecta.ai platform. It utilizes the `config.py`, `models` and `utils` modules to define the parsing logic, manage configuration settings, define data structures, and provide utility functions for file manipulation and directory initialization. The script iterates through a list of users, extracting their profile information, identifying eligible users based on specified criteria, and organizing the data into separate output files. |

</details>

<details closed><summary>config</summary>

| File | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [config.json](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/config/config.json) | The `config.json` file defines the directory structure and file names for storing user data and output results within the `aspecta-parser` repository. It specifies the locations of files containing user information to be parsed, parsed user data, and output files categorized as eligible and not eligible based on the parsing process. |

</details>

<details closed><summary>utils</summary>

| File | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [initFolders.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/utils/initFolders.py) | This module initializes directories and files necessary for the applications operation. It utilizes configuration settings from the `config.py` file to create user and output directories. The module leverages the `osUtils` module for directory and file manipulation. These initialized directories are then used to store data for user information and processed results. |
| [fileUtils.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/utils/fileUtils.py) | The `fileUtils.py` module provides a collection of asynchronous and synchronous file manipulation functions. It enables reading, writing, and deleting lines within files, and checking if a specific line exists within a file. This module is essential for managing data persistence within the `aspecta-parser` repository, facilitating interactions with files across various modules. |
| [osUtils.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/utils/osUtils.py) | The `osUtils.py` module provides utilities for interacting with the file system, including checking for the existence of directories and files, and creating new directories and files. These functions streamline file system operations within the `aspecta-parser` repository, ensuring a consistent and efficient approach to file management across various components. |

<details closed><summary>models</summary>

| File | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [link.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/models/link.py) | The `Link` class within the `models` package of the `aspecta-parser` repository defines a simple data structure to represent a hyperlink. It encapsulates a links name and its corresponding URL, providing a convenient way to manage and access this information within the application. |
| [label.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/models/label.py) | The `Label` class in the `aspecta-parser` repository defines a label object, characterized by a unique name. This class serves as a fundamental building block for representing and managing labels within the applications data structures, facilitating label-based analysis and organization. |
| [userData.py](https://github.com/DGaliaf/aspecta-parser/blob/main/models/userData.py) | The UserData class represents a user in the repositorys architecture. It stores a users name, wallet address, links, and labels. It defines a method to check if a user is eligible based on the presence of specific labels, a valid wallet address, and a link. |
